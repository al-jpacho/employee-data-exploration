    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Inspecting the Data\n",
    "- How many rows and columns are in the dataset?  \n",
    "- What are the column names and data types?  \n",
    "- Show the first 5 rows of the dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Selection & Filtering\n",
    "- Select only the `name` and `salary` columns.  \n",
    "- Show all employees in the **IT** department.  \n",
    "- Find employees who are older than 40.  \n",
    "- Show employees in **Finance** who also work remotely.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Aggregations\n",
    "- What is the **average salary** across the company?  \n",
    "- What is the **average age per department**?  \n",
    "- Which department has the **highest total salary**?  \n",
    "- What is the **maximum years at company**? Who is that employee?  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Data Cleaning / Checks\n",
    "- Are there any missing values in the dataset?  \n",
    "- How many employees work **remotely**?  \n",
    "- What percentage of employees are remote vs in-office?  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Mini Challenges\n",
    "- Create a new column called `salary_per_year` = `salary / years_at_company`.  \n",
    "- Sort employees by `salary_per_year` (highest to lowest).  \n",
    "- Save the sorted results to a new CSV file in the `data/` folder.  \n",
